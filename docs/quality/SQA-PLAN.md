# Inkwell SQA Plan — v1

## Standards

- All code changes follow the PR checklist (docs/reviews, .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- Architecture conformance per ADR-001 (docs/architecture/adr-001-modular.monolith.md)
- API contract conventions per docs/design/api-contract.md

## Reviews

- Every merged change is self-reviewed (author) then peer-reviewed before merge
- Review findings logged in docs/reviews/

## Testing (docs/quality/SQA-PLAN.md)

- Unit tests: Services and Repositories (Jest) — ACTIVE (Lecture 12)
- Integration tests: Routes → Services → Repositories, real test DB (Supertest) — ACTIVE (Lecture 13)
- Component tests: React components (RTL) — ACTIVE (Lecture 13)

- Security testing — starting Lecture 15
- Performance/load testing — deferred; revisit at Lecture 19-20 (architecture scale-out)

## Defect Tracking

- All discovered defects (via review, testing, or manual use) recorded in docs/quality/DEFECT-LOG.md
- Each entry records: cause category, discovery stage, and remediation

## Metrics Tracked

- Defects per lecture/increment
- Defect cause category distribution
- Review turnaround (informal, tracked qualitatively at this project's scale)

## Ownership

- For this course project: the student/team implementing Inkwell owns SQA plan adherence.
